I spent many years as a recording engineer before I became a developer. When it was time to mix a song, we would spend hours, sometimes days, making sure every level was right for each part of the song and all the EQ and compression was perfect. I heard David Bowie once said about this process "You don't ever finish a mix, you just give up." 

I think building an app in this context is much the same way. I could keep building, but as the man, Steve Jobs, himself said "it's not done until it ships." You guys can't evaluate until it's done. So here I am saying this version of the app is done.

## To Run The App
I opted to not used any third party libraries so just do the below steps:

 - Clone this repo down to a local machine.
 - Make sure you are running Xcode Version 12.4 (12D4e).
 - Make sure you are have Swift 5.3.2 installed (in terminal run this command to check: swift --version).
 - Build and run the app (âŒ˜-R in Xcode)
 - enjoy!
